--Disclaimer--
ChatGPT was used extensively throughout the project, but only for debugging and ideation purposes. If I wished to implement a certain feature but didn't know how, I would seek Advice from AI to teach me how to achieve what I wish to achieve and to help me debug my code and find errors. ChatGPT was NOT used to generate entire codes.
